<a href='http://www.lovebrigade.com/' title='Love Brigade' target='_blank'>Love Brigade</a> Clothing announces the Grand Opening of Love Brigade Co Op boutique showroom, located in a new venue in 230 Grand street in the heart of NYC’s trendy Williamsburg shopping district, one block from Bedford Avenue.

The brain child of <a href='http://www.lovebrigade.com/' title='Love Brigade' target='_blank'>Love Brigade</a> will open its doors at 8pm on Friday October 5th to bring all the attendants into the most sought after talent in the industry. Local, national and international designers have been selected to participate in this project and display alongside Love Brigade brand and other established labels.

Showcased designers at the co op’s launch include Alisha, Brains On Fire, Brooklyn Royalty, Couture Saboteur, eeshirtay, KidViscous, Laura Dawson, Leanimal, Love Brigade, Ph by Phillia, Steel Couture, Torsion, Trophy Lodge, and Zulema Griffin ( Project Runway ).

Live music, models, designers, food and drinks will liven up the evening and welcome this new step in the Love Brigade story. Sponsors include our good friends at Fashion Indie, the New Pop, Nicky Digital, Main Drag Music, and Buffalo Cantina.

Love Brigade will also allow a preview to Brigade Studios , its newly built rehearsal spaces to musicians which is located in the same building as the Co Op.

Since its establishment in 2005, Love Brigade has rapidly grown in the fashion and music industries. As a result, just during this month of September 2007, the music-charged fashion label has successfully held three shows, two of them during NYC Fashion Week, with one drawing over 2700 attendees, while presenting their new spring 08 collection: Sesen IV.
