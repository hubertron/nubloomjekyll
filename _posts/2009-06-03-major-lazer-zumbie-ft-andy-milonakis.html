The world really is tiny. <a> Major Lazer</a> is an awesome side project of Diplo and Switch. One if their first videos out is for Zumbie and features the great Andy Milonakis who is dressed up as a zombie wearing an awesome <a href="http://mishkanyc.com/">Mishka</a> t-shirt.

Funny times, great soong, and small world... Enjoy
