Flyer says its all. Looks like Ed Rush, Optical, Dara and Empress will be touching down at Studio B, Friday August 1. The dubstep room will hold its own as well with Dave Q and Dhruva from <a href="http://www.nubloom.org/2008/01/03/sub-swara-in-the-mix/">Sub Swara</a>.

Its been at least 6 years since I saw Ed Rush. This is gonna be awesome, I hope Studio B brings some extra Bass bin!! BOH BOH BOH!

$10 in advance. Tickets at <a href="http://www.ticketweb.com">ticket web</a>.
