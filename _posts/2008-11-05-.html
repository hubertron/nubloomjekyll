As a young American I am very proud to say that for the first time in at least 8 years, Americans across the county have made an intelligent decision and chose Obama as our next president. It was great to see that North Carolina and Virgina both went to Obama and that in Missouri, McCain just squeaked by. It shows that many of of these states are getting more progressive with the the rise of technology and the Internet. I think this election marks a big move to the left for politics in general. I think Republicans will have to be less conservative now to compete in future American politics.

After the news stations picked Obama as the winner the streets in Willliamsburg, Brooklyn erupted. Everyone was yelling out there window Obama! Obama!, fireworks were going off overhead, people were honking their horns. It was complete jubilance, it felt like 8 years of oppression has been lifted off me and my neighbors shoulders. It was a fantastic sight to both see and experience. To me it shows how much this campaign mattered to all people. When I voted yesterday I was in line along with hundreds of people all under the age of 30. To see so many young people doing there civic duty and taking a vested interest in our future was extremely inspiring to see, and to a large degree I felt as if poltics mattered to me for once in my life.

I called a friend after the election resultsÂ  to get his thoughts, and we came to an interesting consensus; That Obama is the first presidential nominee that our generation actually believed in. For us voting wasn't choosing the "lesers of two evils" which was such a common phrase during the Kerry-Bush race but rather we felt like we were voting for a candidate that we actually believed in, and identified with. It was a great thing to have lived through.
