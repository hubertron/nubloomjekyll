Going along with the 10,000 other events happening this weekend is Coney Island's annual Mermaid Parade. From the website:
<blockquote><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Mermaid          Parade celebrates the sand, the sea, the salt air and the beginning of          summer, as well as the history and mythology of Coney Island, Coney Island          pride, and artistic self-expression. The Parade is characterized by participants          dressed in hand-made costumes as Mermaids, Neptunes, various sea creatures,          the occasional wandering lighthouse, Coney Island post card or amusement          ride, as well as antique cars, marching bands, drill teams, and the odd          yacht pulled on flatbed.</font></blockquote>
Somehow I always ended up missing the paraded by being to tired to bike out there but I think i might actually make it there this year. Starts at 2pm.
