This is straight from <a href="http://nonsensenyc.com/">nonsense</a> they put together a fantastic weekly event email.

Rubulad proudly presents:

The Iridescent Ball

A New Year’s Eve masquerade. With the Fisherman, the Hungry March
Band, Vic Thrill and B.A., and the Ja Ja Jahs with Benjamin Ickies
and Joe Exley. DJs: $mall Change, Pork Chop, Mike Simonetti, Tim
(Crypt Records), Alabama Mike, and Kris Anton.

In the Cabaret Room: Viva DeConcini and Mary Feaster (Paprika; Circus

recommend you come early.

You can help us continue to have a Rubulad in this space by being
quiet coming and going, staying inside the space during the event and
not pissing all over the sidewalk as soon as you get around the
corner – which, incidentally, does attract the police and they will
write you a summons. The less our neighbors have to complain about,
the more fun we can have.

G train to Classon, or B61 bus to Flushing
10p doors, 11p show; $20 before 11, in costume, or way late, $25

Pratt Steam Whistles

Midnight blast steam whistles and calliopes operated by Conrad
Milster, chief engineer.

 From Kath of the Kath and Alex in Brooklyn blog: "Every year, we
walk over to the Pratt campus in Brooklyn to watch and hear the
antique steam whistles. The engineer at the Pratt steam engine room
has a massive collection of rare old train steam whistles, and is
nice enough to invite the neighborhood to enjoy them every New Year's
Eve for a weird and wonderful celebration. From what I understand,
the Pratt campus is one of the only steam-powered colleges remaining
in the country (come visit us and we'll try to take you on the steam
engine room tour). The New Year's Eve celebration consists of about
20 steam whistles of various sizes, powered by the Pratt steam engine
room, and the general public is invited to come pull the cords to
blow the whistles. It really is amazing ... and heart-stoppingly
*loud.* I mean, you almost throw up it's so loud.

Forget the crowds and the noise of Times Square, and ring in the New
Year with Trinity Church at their New Year's Eve Bell Ringing. Deemed

Teque, a fabulous, glamtastic, all-star burlesque, champagne soaked,
rock and roll discotèque New Year's Eve for the ages.

NOTE: This is one of the only bar parties with cover that we list on
New Year's. We've never actually been -- we're usually working -- but
people always tell us that it's a good, consistent night, well booked
and low on the index of hassle and drama. It's not super cheap (both
parties should share the same cover), but it's also not the kind of
highway robbery that goes on in most of the legal venues in town.

A New Year's Eve House Party for Maniacs and Lovers

New Years Eve, what are you going to do? Are you going to the bar?
Really? That bar? $40 for what? Well then. Your girlfriend will be
mad and your father will disown you because you knew but you didn't
tell them about New Years Eve 08 at the Church, a New Years Eve House
Party for Maniacs and Lovers.

Look for the white gate between two steeples -- that is where you
will hear sounds of new goddamn bliss emanating. Yes, the space was
once truly a Church as you will see from the structure, obscure snake
handling Christians once did their hoodoo in there. Now it's a home
of madness and Visigoths.

Admission is cheap and gains you entry to the gates of Hedon, with a
complementary glass of champagne, as in real champagne that comes
from Champagne, France. And of course other libations will be on
hand, you silly. And there will be live rock and roll bands: Judith
Light, Discovery, Madam Robot and the Lust Brigade, and Your 33 Black
Angels. There will also be four turntables of reckless breakless
beats grooves and assorted sonic lightening and very very special
guests DJs from across the sea that will take this thing into the
very wee hours of the rest of your life. Dance with a hot stranger.
Marvel at the freaky projections, dig on the sinewy lines of ink and
paint and the grotesque masks that adorn the walls. Shake off every
bad thing you thought you had in this year and get clean getting dirty.

Chapel of Rock and Roll
142 Manhattan Avenue, between Montrose and Meserole, Brooklyn
L train to Montrose station
?p; $8

NOTE: We don't know anything about these folks -- although we like
that Black Angels band -- but we'd be mighty tempted to check it out.
It's got to be the leading contender of the ultracheap New Year's
parties.
