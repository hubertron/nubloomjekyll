<img class="imgright" src='http://nubloom.files.wordpress.com/2007/07/125px-happyhardcore31.jpg' alt='Happycore Vol 3' /> </p> I will admit it. As a teenager I listened to happycore, and to be honest I enjoyed it. I danced my ass off till 9am on many occasions. For those of you who may not have heard of this genre here is a great definition curtsey of   <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Happy_Hardcore" target="_blank">Wikipedia.org</a> Happycore can be defined as:
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<blockquote>Happycore is a form of dance music typified by a very fast tempo (usually around 165-180 BPM), often coupled with male or female vocals, and saccharine lyrics. Its characteristically 4/4 beat "happy" sound distinguishes it from most other forms of breakbeat hardcore, which tend to be "darker". In its original incarnation, it was often characterized by piano riffs, synth stabs and spacey effects. This genre of music is closely related to the typically Dutch genre of Gabber. Happy hardcore evolved from rave music around 1991â€“1993, as the original house music-based rave became faster and began to include breakbeats, evolving into breakbeat hardcore.</blockquote></p>

<p>Basically its God's gift to teenage ravers, but it does have an addicting sound to it. </p><p>
