Ed is working on a photo ethnography of NYC's bicycle culture. He has
been photographing alleycats, goldsprints, the vintage Schwinn clubs of Bushwick, (a block from my house) road races, track races, Bicyle Fetish, the Bicycle Film Festival, etc, etc.

Now, he is doing some portraits.

So grab your bike and a friend or two and find him (us).

Williamsburg Bridge
Friday 6/22
6PM to sundown

No fancy lights, seamless backdrops or air conditioned studios. Just
you, your bike, the bridge, friends and of course BEER! (Bring a water
bottle or a plastic cup)
