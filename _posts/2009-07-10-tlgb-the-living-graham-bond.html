<a>TLGB (The Living Graham Bond)</a> despite the weird name is a great dj/producer. He won the AC Slate remix competition from earlier this year despite a strong competition. He also just joined up with Venga Digital for a single and EP release. Check out the following remixes:

A bassline driven rejig of Jack Penate's single "Today's Tonight" which spent a month in Kissy Sell Out's myspace chart and has featured on his Radio One show. <a href="http://www.zshare.net/download/622939365195cc46/">Download</a>. And a subby chilled out remix of the classic "You're Not Alone" by Olive. <a href="http://www.zshare.net/download/6229382279d8acca/">Download</a>.
