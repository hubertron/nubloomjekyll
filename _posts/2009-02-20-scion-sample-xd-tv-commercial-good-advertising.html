<p>
<a href="http://www.scion.com/">Scion</a> has really been getting this whole marketing to youth culture thing right. In the above commercial shot by <a href="http://www.imaginaryforces.com/">Imaginary Forces</a>, you can really see Scion grab hold of the hyper individualized mashup culture we live into and reconstitute in a meaningful way it to sell a car. </p>
<p> Seriously between sponsoring DJ's like Rusko and Diplo and producing commercials like this I can't help but like what Scion is offering me.
