If you have been to the site in the past few days you might of noticed it acting it a bit strangely. Well it was because I transfered webhosts to a new server which should net much better performance, but in rebuilding my SQL tables I overwrote this Wordpress with another one. It was a mess but it should be all cleaned up now and the site should be functioning so much better so enjoy!
