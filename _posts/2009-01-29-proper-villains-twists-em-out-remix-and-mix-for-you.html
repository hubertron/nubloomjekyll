For those of you who don't know the <a href="http://www.myspace.com/propervillaindjs" target="_blank">Proper Villains</a> have been around a long time making awesome Drum and Bass tracks under the same name and some other aliases. You might know them best as a drum and bass outlet doing sick sick original and remixed tracks that would play out at <a href="http://www.directdrive.net"> Direct Drive </a>  parties ever week.

As DnB has involved into a new sound so has Proper Villians, within you can find an eclectic  mix of electro, house, mashup, hip hop and classic rave creating an awesome new sound that this blog just can't get over.

The folks over at one of my favorite blogs <a href="http://palmsout.blogspot.com">Palms Out</a> are hosting this awesome mix.

Expect big things from Proper Villains this year
