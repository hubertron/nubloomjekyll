Reid drops another killer mix just in time for the cool weather booty electro dancing season. (What you didn't know Novemember was Booty Electro season!)
<br /> Don't let this one slip through your fingers.

I have known Reid since the 90's but since some people might not be familiar . Check below the fold for what Wikipedia has to say about her as well as  the tracklisting.

<blockquote>
<p>When Reid Speed began spinning records in 1996, she first generated curiosity as one of few female DJs at the time. However, she quickly earned respect for her talent in the highly competitive NYC scene. By the summer of 1997 she was working with rave promoters, Stuck on Earth Promotions and the following year as a member of the Direct Drive crew. At these events she cut her teeth playing alongside the top names in the genre.<br /><br />

1998 found Reid working at DJ Dara's Breakbeat Science, the first record store in the United States to specialize in drum &amp; bass records. Capitalizing on their large and widespread customer base, her demos soon spread, which led to touring in the United States, Puerto Rico, Ireland, Canada, and Mexico. A 1998 visit to England sparked an interest in UK garage which inspired her to promote her own events.
<br /><br />
The 2001 release of her debut mix CD, Resonance, yielded the singles "Mr Fix It" with Ming &amp; FS, and "Picture This" with DJ Seen. In support of the release, a 40-date tour sponsored by Mixer magazine introduced her sound to an even wider audience. 2005 saw collaborations with MC Dino and DJ Swamp on a full length album. In March 2006, her remix of Disorder's "Deadline" was released on Acumen Records.
<br /><br />
She is now based in Los Angeles, California, where she manages Break Down, an event showcasing UK garage and Nu skool breaks.</p></blockquote> Source <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reid_Speed" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>
