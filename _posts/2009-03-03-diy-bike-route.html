Pretty cool idea for tracking bike movements through the city using chalk I wonder if a prototype will ever be built.

<blockquote>
  <p>'Contrail' is a design concept that enables cyclists to increase their visibility to cars, pedestrians, and each other. Conceived by Pepin Gelardi and Teresa Herrmann, this frame-mounted device would allow cyclists to make their mark on the street with faint lines of chalk. The rear wheel spins a smooth trail of color onto the pavement as the bike whizzes along.</p>
  <p>Contrail leaves an impression based on the cumulative movements of many
cyclists over time (a more lasting variation on the BYO bike lane concept employed by the laser-projected <a href="http://www.streetsblog.org/2009/01/16/byo-bike-lane/">LightLane</a>). Its provocative visual language lies somewhere between sky
calligraphy, temporary street graffiti, and overlapping footprints in
the snow. <br /></p>
  <p>Gelardi and Herrmann proposed Contrail for the <a href="http://www.design21sdn.com/competitions/11/finalists?page=1">Power to the Pedal competition</a>, and are currently developing a prototype. They envision 'a new cycle of biking participation' in which the criss-crossing chalk ribbons would pique curiosity, identify more popular routes, and inspire more cyclists to hit the road.</p>
