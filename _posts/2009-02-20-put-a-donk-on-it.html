<blockquote>Yeah, it's the Mecca of Donk; the heard of Donk. Literally there's a load of Donk that goes on. </blockquote>


<p><a href="http://vbs.tv">VBS.TV</a> just re-discovered high BPM house music now called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bouncy_house#Present_day">Donk</a> and exploits it by calling it some new sound. If your interested in check out the full 5 part series on the "Donk Phenomenon" head over to <a href="http://www.vbs.tv/video.php?id=12150086001">VBS</a> to be mildly bored by a rehashing of a genre as old as electronic music.</p>
