From what I can tell DJ Distance has been around for a few years. I am relatively new to the relatively new dubstep scene and just came across this track randomly and totally fell in love.

Someone get this man over to NY! I love love dubstep shows! Supposedly he played in May, but I totally missed that bus. Anyway check out his track Demons
