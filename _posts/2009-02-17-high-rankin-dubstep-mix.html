<a href="http://www.myspace.com/highrankin">High Rankin</a> is a dubstep DJ/Producer that seems to have come from Jungle/DNB roots. Like Me! and now has a style that transcends those genre's into a style that is all his.

If the early 2000's was all about micro genre's the late 2000's are are about convergence. A great thing.
