</p><p>The murderous hatred being directed toward Toyota's 'Saved by Zero' ads has been building for a few weeks now, and it's become semi-official with <a href="http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5gLHlYbnhuANpXVn0z3MntM1retcAD948UTAO0">this Associated Press story</a>. A number of Web sites—<em><a href="http://www.esquire.com/the-side/football-column/saved-by-zero-commercial-103008?src=rss">Esquire</a></em>, <a href="http://www.bestweekever.tv/2008/11/05/yessss-suck-it-saved-by-zero-toyota-commercial/">Best Week Ever</a>, <a href="http://consumerist.com/5075394/yes-its-official-that-stupid-saved-by-zero-commercial-isnt-working">Consumerist</a> and <a href="http://jalopnik.com/5072615/toyota-wont-stop-saved-by-zero-ads-despite-pleas-from-thousands-of-facebookers">Jalopnik</a> among them—have been hosting rants about the ads, which feature the admittedly awful 1983 song 'Saved by Zero' by British new-wave group The Fixx. By and large, viewers feel an urge to end their own lives and/or other people's when the ads come on: 'It makes me want to kill someone/never ever buy a Toyota.' 'Marketing 101, don't piss consumers off, don't get on their bad sides, don't cultivate contempt.' 'I CAN'T EVEN EXPRESS MY OUTRAGE WITHOUT USING CAPS LOCK.' Clearly it's the feel-bad campaign of the year, and from a company (and industry) that doesn't need any extra help in <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/07/business/worldbusiness/07toyota.html?hp">hurtling down the crapper</a>.<br /><br />
