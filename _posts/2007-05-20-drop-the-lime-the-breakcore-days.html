I recently came across a film called "Notes on Breakcore." I was curious what the Europeans had to say about this unique genre. If your interested in it as a genre, check out the directors website: <a href="http://breakcore.net/">http://breakcore.net/</a>

More interestingly however was seeing my friend Luca aka Drop the Lime aka Curses! the man behind the amazing <a href="http://troubleandbass.blogspot.com">Trouble and Bass</a> parties being on this European documentary.

Check out the video below to see what he has to say about breakcore and the internet. Quite funny..

*Warning* This is a 30mb file, so I recommend pushing play, then pause.. waiting a few moments and push play again so it doesn't get all skippy like.
