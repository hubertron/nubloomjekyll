Hey! You! Music blogger! Now is your opportunity to still a bit of Muxtapes thunder and install a clone on your webserver and to have an elegant way to let your audience listen to your track selections of the week.

Awesomeness all around. Send me an email aso [at] nubloom [dot] org if you create a mix and I will link off to it.
