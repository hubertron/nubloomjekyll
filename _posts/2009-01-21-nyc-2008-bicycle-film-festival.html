J Martinez takes some of my favorite photo's. He really is a truly gifted photographer. Here he puts together a bunch of those awesome shots taken with his 40D with a nice short 24mm lens. Music is Kanye West.

Check out more of his stuff on <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/j2martinez/">Flickr</a>. :)
