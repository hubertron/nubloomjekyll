<p>The awesome NYC label known as <a href="http://www.mishkanyc.com/home.php">Mishka</a> put out a mix from month to month that usually lights up the blogosphere with the awesome djs they snag weekly. It seems that these guys have the same connections as the folks over at <a href="http://nubloom.files.wordpress.com/2009/03/5950a0b3cd21c08e4b741109de42c2d91.jpg2009/02/20/scion-sample-xd-tv-commercial-good-advertising/">Scion</a>.</p>

This month they have the "inventor" of the modern dubstep sound, the one the only <a href="http://www.myspace.com/skreamuk">Skream</a>!!!!

From Miskha:

<blockquote>For our 6th installment of Keep Watch, we’re excited to have Croydon, UK’s own Skream keeping our speakers on sonic overload. Skream helped build the burgeoning dubstep scene through the UK and we’re honored to have him drop this mix for you guys, exclusively through our Keep Watch series. A perfect example of the dark and grimy vibes coming out of the dubstep underground, Skream unleashes what we can only describe as bass bazookas into your headphones and speakers. The mix goes from heavy and murky to quick and danceable and calms it down near the end with a soulful outro.

Croydon’s wonderkid, Skream discovered making music at the young age of 15 and hasn’t looked back since. Helping to evolve the dubstep genre Skream has worked with many of the top artists in the scene including fellow Tempa lablemates Hatcha and Benga. Often described as “a wild child” Skream’s subdued alter ego comes through in each and every track he produces, combining a minimal and technical approach with a keen sense of composition. Skream is set to continue killing the dubstep scene for sometime to come.</blockquote>
