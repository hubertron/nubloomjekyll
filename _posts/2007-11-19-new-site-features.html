I got motivated this morning and added 2 new features to the top of the pages. If you look up you may see a Mixes and a Video button. Clicking on either of them will sort the blog posts specifically by that topic.

So say you don't care about bikes and just want some heavy bass. Click on Mixes, and you'll only see the music that I post about and not the bike stuff!

As always the search still works, so if you have something in mind, just search for it. Enjoy!
