I randomly fell into the <a href="http://www.myspace.com/newyoungponyclub" target="_blank">NYPC</a> some time last year. I was drunk and walking around Williamsburg and got texted that the <a href="http://www.thejuanmaclean.com/" target="_blank">The Juan Maclean</a> was playing at some art gallery. So I showed up and found the NYPC playing. Needless to say I had a great time. They have such a high energy live act. Definitely worth checking out this Thursday.
