Tricia Romano, the Fly Life writer for the Village Voice is hanging up her hat on her job as staff writer for NYC nightlife. She has some interesting things to say about the DnB scene. She like me, grew up in the DNB scene, saw its brief rise, and then its collapse. I will always still love the music.

If you grew up with DnB or have read Fly Life check this out.
