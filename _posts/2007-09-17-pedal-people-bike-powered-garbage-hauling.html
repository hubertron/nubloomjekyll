<p> In the small town of Northampton (pop. 30,000) a group of bicyclists banded together to form a pedal powered garbage/recycling hauling service for their town who outsources residential garbage pickup.
<br /> Amazingly they work year round in all conditions for very competitive $30 weekly rate. This beats my current $200/mo garbage service here in NYC by far.
<br /> This is the first time I have heard of bicyclist's doing this but I sincerly hope that more towns will pick it up, or maybe the Pedal People can franchise out the business. NYC could benefit from this greatly.
