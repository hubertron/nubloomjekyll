<img src='http://nubloom.files.wordpress.com/2007/07/hd212_normal1.jpg' alt='HD 212 Pro Headphones' /> I have been rocking these Sennheiser's for at least 2 years now and they still keep pounding the bass in my ears. Maybe its because <a href="http://www.sennheiserusa.com/newsite/productdetail.asp?transid=005180" target="_blank">Sennhesier</a> has listed one of the feature as "High levels and crisp bass for modern rhythm-driven music."

What sub-100 headphones do you guys use for listening to music at the office, on the train or wherever you listen to music?
