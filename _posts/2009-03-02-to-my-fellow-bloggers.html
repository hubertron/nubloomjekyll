Hello Fellow Bloggers,

I love you. You find the best music. You know tons about the musicians. You get exclusive tracks early. I only have one complaint and is a big one...

STOP USING SHAREBEE, zShare, YouSendIt, etc....

Its incredible irritating for the users that try to use it every day. There are so many other options out there not to mention a Dreamhost account is like $5/month. Please consider this.

I have so much love for my fellow bloggers, but think of your audience. The ones that you blog for.

Thanks,

End Rant.
