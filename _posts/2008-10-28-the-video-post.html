Check out some tunage I have come across in my exploration of the new MTV Music site. From Dance to Hiphop and and everywhere in between.


Warning: This is gonna be all over the genre map :)

Classic track and great video directed by the now brooklyn based Michel Gondry. Really downtempo, really helped me define my teenage years when this and Hackers (the movie) came out together.

BASSSSSSS for miles. Awesome track, better if it was just the instrumental. This track is begging for a new vocal track.

A dirty little secret I have is that I used to be really into trance. The uplifting piano's and vocals couldn't help but inspire me to dance late into the night and this track is one that that stood of being both a great dance track and a great one to just listen to.

All about the drum beat on this one and Dizzee's signature voice. If you recognize this track but not familiar with Dizzee look to David LaChapelle's documentary about krumping called <a href="http://www.apple.com/trailers/lions_gate/rize/">Rize</a>. Its a dominant track throughout the film.

RuPaul defined an interesting time in music. The club scene was at it 2nd big revival. E was big. Gay men were coming out in a big way in clubs all over NYC clubland and this track was an anthem of sorts to the way people lived during that time.

Let's be honest here, this was always a weird song. Scat was a music genre where a person sings very fast. This was pretty much the only song in the genre that went mainstream. Everyone I knew in the 90's knew it and sung it. Listening to it a decade later I have to say its still catchy.

Not Snoop's first video, but definitely the one that cemented his career and the Gangsta's raps sound in white America's mind. I think I have listened to this track well over 1000 times over the years. Go Snoop!

Not much I can say about this track that you don't already know. It got Weezer famous. It suck in people's brain. It made people happy. Overall good time all around.

<br /><br />
I could keep going, I have another 50 videos in mind. Let me know if you like posts like this and I will put another one together.
